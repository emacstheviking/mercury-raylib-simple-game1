# Mercury and Raylib Simple Video Game

You will need to have built a working mercury compiler supporting hlc.gc on
your system, and also installed raylib.

This repo will just stagnate as the real work continues on my bitbnucket
account but after a discussion with u/MadScientistMoses on reddit and their
interest in seeing 'a bigger Mercury code base' then I decided to stop being a
moron about showing off code (been ripped off in the past, still hurting) I
decided to take a snapshot and push it to Github.

The code DOES compile and link on my system, there are no compile errors
error. It's **working code** as pushed. If you have issues, well, there's the
Issue thing!


I used a MacMini ARM64, used Homebrew to install Raylib and just went for it.

Raylib is a GREAT library!
